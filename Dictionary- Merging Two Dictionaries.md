## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

dict1 = {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}
dict2 = {'Thirty': 30, 'Fourty': 40, 'Fifty': 50}
dict1.update(dict2)
print(dict1)
```
## Output
![442445762-3f1e5fce-0f65-463b-a7ea-831af3911b14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dc31d59-d71e-49e9-9c7c-ff73f5e92e82)

## Result
The program successfully merges two dictionaries using the unpacking operator, with overlapping keys in dict2 overwriting those in dict1.
